# Program to read two numbers from the user and print their sum, product, and difference

# Read two numbers from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Calculate the product of the two numbers
product = num1 * num2

# Calculate the difference between the two numbers
difference = num1 - num2

# Print the results
print("Sum: ", sum)
print("Product: ", product)
print("Difference: ", difference)
