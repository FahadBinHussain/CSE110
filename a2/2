# Program to read the radius of a circle and print its circumference and area

import math

# Read the radius from the user
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate the circumference of the circle
circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius

# Calculate the area of the circle
area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

# Print the results
print("Circumference: ", circumference)
print("Area: ", area)
