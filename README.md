# Personal University Assignments Repository

Welcome to the Personal University Assignments Repository! This repository serves as a central location for me to store, track, and manage all of my university assignments and projects. 

## About
This repository contains all of my university assignments and projects, organized by assignment number and course name. The assignments range from simple coding exercises to more complex projects, and cover a wide range of topics in computer science. 

## How to Use
To start using the repository, I simply need to navigate to the directory of the desired assignment and then follow the instructions provided in the README file for that assignment. If there are any updates or changes to an assignment, they will be reflected in this repository. The repository can also be used as a reference for me to check and compare my progress against my previous assignments.

## Future Reference
By keeping all of my university assignments and projects in one centralized location, I can easily access and reference them in the future. This will be especially useful as I progress in my studies and build up a portfolio of work.

## Enjoy!
I hope that this repository makes my university experience more organized and efficient. Happy coding!
